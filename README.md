# DSC180A-Q1-Project
## Introduction

This repository contains the data and code for the Quarter 1 checkpoint. This reflects the joint efforts of Bhagya Ram and Huize Mao. The requirements.txt file located within the /API_data_extraction folder lists the software dependencies. To set up your environment, run the following command to set up your environment:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

All the source code for plotting and EDA is located at /src folder, while the analysis.ipynb include the walkthrough writeup to our experiment thought process and result presentation.

   ```
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```
